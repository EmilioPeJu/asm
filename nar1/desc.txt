We need a shellcode in the environment variable EGG
We create the shellcode from scratch, creating the asm and extracting the text
section.
The following consideration is not necesary here:
- a line in a environment variable is read as a c string,
in this challenge it is not copied, therefore, it doesn't matter, but
it is a good practice to avoid null bytes in shellcodes
