Just overflow the buffer until you hit the target variable, and set the value 
you need.
Keep in mind 2 things:
- x86 is little endian, so you need to set the byte sequence in reverse order
- if you pipe the payload and nothing more, the shell will exit as soon as it
gets EOF, a good trick is: cat payload - | binary
that way the binary will get the payload and then the standard input
