Format string vulnerability
In the stack, at the moment of snprintf call, we have:
[address to buffer] [lenth of buffer] [address to argv[1]][buffer]

snprintf will take the 3 first parameters, and if it requires more
it will continue taking parameters from the buffer,
therefore we can use the first part of the buffer to write the
address of i and then %...x to modify the count and %1$hn will
write the count as a short in the first argument (starting in buffer)
